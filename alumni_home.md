# Alumni Platform Prototype

This is the homepage for the alumni platform. 
This page displays posts from alumni the user has followed, invitations/questions from alumni and parents, and news feeds from the school.

There are 4 major function tabs:
1. [Chats]() for DM and group chats with alumni with the same tags
2. [Q&A]() for answering/asking questions to/from alumni and parents.
3. [Posts]() for broadcasting to everyone/everyone with specific tags
4. [Me]() for setting up profiles, notification settings, and viewing badges.
