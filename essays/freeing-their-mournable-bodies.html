  <h1>Freeing their Mournable Bodies: Women’s Struggle in Postcolonial Zimbabwe</h1>
  <p>2020.10.30</p>
  <p class="au-notes">This piece is a review for This Mournable Body, a searing novel by Zimbabwean writer Tsitsi Dangarembga. I investigate the synergy of patriarchy and colonialism in a Zimbabwean context and its implications for the world.</p>
  <p>Zimbabwe achieved internationally recognized independence in 1980, but the promise of ethnic and gender equality did not follow. Instead, the new society much hoped for appeared imbued with coercion especially towards Zimbabwean women. Tsitsi Dangarembga’s This Mournable Body reflects such coercion and reveals its persisting impact: The liberation struggle failed to empower them against Zimbabwean men and patriarchal oppression. And in the postcolonial capitalist system, women are made especially vulnerable to commodification and exploitation. They thus submit to or even internalize oppression, which isolates them and renders them indifferent to the suffering of fellow women. Lacking mutual support, they are further forced to comply to patriarchal violence. Dangarembga illustrates such mutual construction of an oppressive structure and submissive individuals through a second-person narrative of Tambudzai, the female protagonist.</p>
  <p>Tambudzai’s description of working women under oppression reveals to readers that the liberation struggle did not end patriarchal oppression, but was just a transfer of power between two male regimes. She narrates that her housemate Makomborero “works at the Ministry of Justice as a legal secretary” (Dangarembga, loc. 820). But when she is raped by a male housemate, she “only thought let him finish” (loc. 879) and blames herself: “Why am I so foolish? Why didn’t I hear him?” (loc. 859). Her profession in law contrasts with her inability to seek justice for herself. This shows that patriarchy continues to intimidate women in postcolonial Zimbabwe to the extent that they naturalize it and “savage themselves with self-accusation” (loc. 860) for not adapting. The disparity between having a career and experiencing oppression also makes Nyasha’s housemaid Mai Taka “sit petrified between the two authorities” (loc. 2529) of her employer and her husband. While she gathers the courage to go to the cinema with her employer’s family against the will of her husband, she endures being beaten for doing so. She is “relieved to have been spared a beating and observes it is like a blessing in disguise that her husband seems to have absconded” (loc. 2680). By depicting working women enduring immense patriarchal oppression, Dangarembga disillusions readers about women’s emancipation through working, and shows that liberation from colonialists empowered Zimbabwean women little against oppression by their own men.</p>
  <p>In addition to persisting domestic patriarchy, postcolonial capitalism menaces Zimbabwean women with commodification. As Nyasha’s workshops to enlighten young Zimbabwean women turns out unsuccessful, Leon remarks: “They want women the way they are now, just something with a shelf life, that ages. Can’t you see there’s nothing about women to interest any kind of capital unless it’s solutions for aging?” (Dangarembga, loc. 2327). His remorseless remark reveals to Nyasha and the readers that the western capitalist system incentivizes against the development of a feminine consciousness. It is lucrative to keep women as objects whose value depends solely on bodily beauty, so that women consume to maintain it. Once Zimbabwean women are reduced to their bodies, they also become vulnerable to commodification. They are coerced to satisfy the European desire for primitive spectacles: To secure her career, Tambudzai “delivers the message concerning the women’s torsos” (loc. 4440) and tells her kinswomen to dance naked to please European tourists. In exchange of income, they comply and submit their bodies to the western illusion of Shona exoticism – “dancing authentically … minimal, like loincloths, naked … torsos” (loc. 4146). Women are assimilated into the ruthless capitalist system as either commodities for consumption by foreigners or accomplices in commodifying their kin. The tension between toy capitalism and femininity culminates where Tambudzai’s mother stops Herr Bachmann from taking pictures of Tambudzai beside her, exclaiming “You want to laugh at my child when you are back home because her mother is a naked old woman!’” (loc. 4495). Dangarembga depicts a moment when the commodification of women intrudes on a mother’s love for her child – the most fundamental feminine instinct. Her rebellion against the commodifying force is ardent yet feeble. Tambudzai’s employer Tracey repeats: “She’s got to go” (loc. 4493). Tracey’s conviction underscores that the capitalist system pushes for an utter submission of the women’s dignity to profit and that of Zimbabwean culture to European consumerism. Thus, women in postcolonial Zimbabwe were employed but not empowered, freed but still commodified.</p>
  <p>Women’s compliance to patriarchy then reinforces patriarchy’s control over them. Exhausted by oppression and disappointment, Tambudzai gives up on independent thinking. When asked for opinions, she has none and “raises her shoulders and shakes her head” (Dangarembga, loc. 2918). Her fatigue in contemplating anything beyond “clawing her way forward” (loc. 2934) reflects women’s passive submission due to excessive oppression. They thus estrange themselves from one another. When Tambudzai joins the crowd to guffaw at Gertrude, her roommate who is harassed at a combi station, she feels herself “grow and grow until … she is much bigger than herself and this is wonderful” (loc. 275). Tambudzai feels secure when aligning herself with the crowd. Her narrative illustrates that the need to shelter themselves from the menacing patriarchy forces women to be unresponsive to their fellow women’s misery. Eventually, Tambudzai becomes complicit in the oppressive structure when she persuades her fellow women to dance naked and complies to remove her mother who defends her from the derogatory gaze of Herr Bachmann. She “thinks she is obeying her boss’s instructions” though “grief … rushes into her throat” (loc. 4493) and renders her powerless to do so. The pressure to submit overrides empathy and, though only momentarily, kinship. Women thus forgo these bonds and become complicit in isolating their fellow women. To survive in the liberal order imbued with racism and sexism, marginalized women like Tambudzai “internalize liberal epistemology to maximize security” and “work with it for short-term gains while avoiding conflictive emotional investments” (Sa’Ar, 681). Thus, each woman is oppressed to leave others alone, and the lack of solidarity makes each more vulnerable to oppression. Their personal compliance with the oppressive structure collectively reproduces the structure. Dangarembga illustrates such mutual construction of structure and individuals through the second-person narrative: Tambudzai not only tells her own and other women’s experiences of oppression to readers. She also talks to herself and remarks on these experiences. From her remarks, readers could see how she became indifferent to her kinswomen and finally complicit in reducing them to “unmournable bodies” displayed to please westerners.</p>
  <p>Tambudzai thus becomes complicit in perpetuating sexual abuse and ethnic inequality. It is exemplified by “sex-industry and sex-tourism in the Third World which bring back forms of slavery that we have imagined extinct with the demise of the colonial empires” (Seneviratne). Zimbabwean women are not simply subjected to both oppressive hierarchies; domestic patriarchy deprives them of the benefits from national emancipation, and their ethnicity drives the capitalist attempt to sexualize and exoticize them for consumption by Europeans. They experience intersectionality as a synergy of patriarchy and colonialism – each aggravates women’s oppression in the other. The beautiful promise of post-coloniality obscures this unforgiving reality, so that the emancipated men “stride in front” while women “follow timidly behind, carrying groceries, baby and diapers” (Seneviratne) and are further silenced. Through Tambudzai’s emotionally conflicting narrative, Dangarembga reveals to her readers that the first step after decolonization is to soberly recognize its disregard of women. For their true emancipation, their struggles that are submerged in the elation for independence must be seen.</p>
