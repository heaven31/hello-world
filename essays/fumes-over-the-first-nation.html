  <h1>Fumes over the First Nation: Environmentalism in the postcolonial world</h1>
  <p>2020.12.7</p>
  <p class="au-notes">This piece is inspired by Cherie Dimaline's novella The Marrow Thieves. Her work imagines from a first-person view the mental turbulence of First Nation Canadians in a dystopian future. This essays reviews her work with reference to the realities of environmentalism in the postcolonial age.</p>
  <p>The young Swedish climate change activist Greta Thunberg received global attention for her 2018 speech at the United Nations Climate Change Conference in Katowice, Poland:</p>
  <ol>
    <p>“You only speak of green eternal economic growth because you are too scared of being unpopular. You only talk about moving forward with the same bad ideas that got us into this mess, even when the only sensible thing to do is pull the emergency brake. You are not mature enough to tell it like it is. Even that burden you leave to us children.” (Thunberg)</p>
  </ol>
  <p>Thunberg’s speech shrewdly critiqued a collective short-sightedness on the urgency of the environmental crisis. But regarding “pulling the emergency brake” as a panacea fails to attend to the reality: The uneven distribution of wealth, power and industry impedes environmentalist movements worldwide. Euro-American nations can achieve green growth without sacrificing its wealth. But making it possible is their sustained exploitation of natural resources on other continents, through direct extraction in the past and indirectly by outsourcing hazardous industries at present. Advocating green growth in the west often only causes an “offload of rich-nation toxins onto the world’s poorest continent” to “appease the rising discontent of rich-nation environmentalists” (Nixon, 2). Correspondingly, the neoliberal “framework of critical competition” (Fanon, 35) force postcolonial nations to abandon environmentally-friendly lifestyles. Colonial exploitation obstructed development in postcolonial nations. After emancipation, they compete in the neoliberal market without wealth or advanced technology. To alleviate poverty, they are forced to depend heavily on exporting natural resources as their sole comparative advantage. Many see western industries return. Thus, to accuse postcolonial nations alone of hazardous extraction ignores persisting oppression that forces them to trade nature for survival. However, this coerced exploitation on “out-of-sight continents” (Nixon, 2) remain invisible to Euro-Americans. The struggle of postcolonial environmentalists is submerged in the applause for their western counterparts.</p>
  <p>Here we analyze the western epistemology that justifies such colonial and neo-colonial environment exploitation and the response from postcolonial environmentalists. Colonizers equate progress to conquest of nature. Thus, they discharge the indigenous ideal of coexistence with nature and justify exploitation of colonized land. Further, “an insatiable quest for quicker sensation” (Nixon, 8) in western consumer societies causes an ignorance of incremental environmental hazards on distant continents. In response, postcolonial environmentalists negate the anthropocentric view on environment through narratives that revitalize cultural ties to nature. In the Marrow Thieves, Cherie Dimaline uses indigenous narratives to show that coexistence with nature offers indigenous people security and inspiration. The narratives also reveal compellingly the harm that “incremental and accretive” environmental exploitation (Nixon, 2) does to the colonized.</p>
  <p>Colonialism is anthropocentric as well as white-supremacist. The pursuit of conquering nature for western use justifies exploiting indigenous environment and subjugating indigenous people. Dimaline describes the plunder by settler-colonizers in Canada from a First Nation perspective: “America reached up and started sipping on our lakes with a great metal straw.” (Dimaline, loc. 363) Victims of colonial extraction personify colonization as an aggressive individual and depict the colonizers’ pursuit of resources as a thirst. Verbs “reached up” and “sipping” vividly captures their greed for indigenous water. This reveals that colonizers conceive nature as mere commodities for human consumption and thus conduct atrocities in the name of industry. Anthropocentrism then justifies oppressing indigenous people to seize their habitats. By regarding industrial extraction as proper and more advanced, colonizers legitimize “looking for ways they could take what the indigenous had and administer themselves” (Dimaline, loc. 1271). Thus, colonizers move the indigenous “off lands that were deemed ‘necessary’ to the government” and fills their lands “with water companies and wealthy corporate investors” (Dimaline, loc. 1275). Dimaline depicts indigenous helplessness in face of invasion justified by anthropocentrism. The First Nation is expelled from land because colonizers firmly believe they make better use of it, because the epistemology that commodifies nature also demands subjugating any folk that does not do so. The irrational thirst for conquest culminates when colonizers would rather “hire security firms to walk around … corporate-sponsored vacancy” (Dimaline, loc. 819) than leave it for indigenous people. In resonance with Frantz Fanon’s claim that “infrastructure is also a superstructure” (5), colonizers cite Euro-American superiority to legitimize extraction from indigenous habitats, and use the industry built from it to validate Euro-American superiority. Propelled by this ideology that equates conquest itself to progress, colonizers engage in a constant “movement of aggression, which leads to enslavement” (Fanon, 28) of both indigenous people and their environment.</p>
  <p>The colonial age is imbued with plunder in the name of progress. But in the neo-colonial era, self-proclaimed progressiveness alone does not enable Euro-Americans to declare themselves “environmental vanguard” (Nixon, 254) while ignoring persisting indirect exploitation.  A short-sightedness driven by greed produces such collective ignorance. In contrast, the indigenous people retain a strong historical consciousness embodied in stories. It enables them to conceive and express environmental violence. Dimaline depicts the colonizers’ short-sightedness as both temporal and spatial. The diasporic Anishinaabe Miigwans recalls that when American invasion for water began, “no one cared about long-range things like courting votes for the next election” but instead focused on “keeping valued, wealthy community members safe” (Dimaline, loc. 1275). Miigwans’ narrative reveals the irony that the calculating colonizers fail to see the long-range payback for their instantaneous gain. Their ignorance is spatial too: “At the same time rivers were being sucked to south and then east to the highest bidder, the North was melting” (Dimaline, loc. 372). Dimaline juxtaposes ongoing colonial extraction with melting icecaps – an aftermath of cumulative exploitation. To satisfy “perceived immediate need” (Nixon, 3), the colonizers are too indulged in the loot at hand to see that its aftermath is razing other places to ruins. As a result of turbo-capitalism (Nixon, 4), the western public attends only to immediate, proximal spectacles; Environmental violence on other continents are too distant and incremental to be visible. In the neocolonial era, this short-sightedness makes Euro-Americans conceive themselves devoted practitioners of environmentalism, whereas their indirect exploitation of indigenous habitats escapes the attention of even western environmentalists. Thus, western economists magisterially claim that “environmentalism is a concern of the upper and middle class” and “poor countries simply aren’t interested” (Guha, 1). The intruder of environment now theorizes itself as the vindicator. And neo-colonial regimes manipulate public ignorance to continue exploitation while averting moral accusation. Ironically, indigenous people, whose worldview colonizers despise as backward, instead retain an environmental far-sightedness. Leading a group of young diasporic First Nations, Miigwans tells them stories about the colonization of their lands. The collective memory of the group is expanded temporally: They recall the past when “the freshest lakes and the cleanest rivers were on our lands” (Dimaline, loc. 363) and contrast it with the present when “the waters were grey and thick like porridge” (Dimaline, loc. 368). Not only is a historical awareness embodied in stories, but also is it passed on to the young generation. Thus, the First Nations stay acutely conscious of the cumulative harm that incremental extraction brings. Stories also retain the awareness and knowledge to restore nature for the future. Clarence, a leader of the diasporic Indian community, encourages his folk that they “have knowledge kept through the first round of the blasted schools, from before that” to “heal the land” (Dimaline, loc. 2734). He highlights that stories can empower the diasporic to return and prosper with nature together, because they retain knowledge through time and violence. Stories impart the First Nation people a long-standing environmental sensibility (Guha, 6) that makes western colonizers appear as mere “angry children throwing tantrums” (Dimaline, loc. 2737). Their short-sighted violence is dwarfed by indigenous faith and wisdom accumulated in stories.<p>
  <p>Postcolonial environmentalists thus invoke compelling narratives of their kin to resist anthropocentric imperialism. Frenchie, the protagonist whose family was taken by colonizers, observes on his diasporic journey that “stars were perforations revealing the bleached skeleton of the universe” (Dimaline, loc. 167). He conceives the universe as an entity with its own body and reveres its grandeur. Also, when his crew hunt down a deer, they “allow the deer to take his dreams with him so he had all the magic he would to find the next world” (Dimaline, loc. 2748). The belief that prey as part of nature deserves a peaceful afterlife sharply opposes the colonial materialism which reduces every colonized being to commodities. Frenchie’s narrative declares compellingly that nature itself is a conscious entity – a belief which colonizers deny to justify exploitation. Further, colonizers in the novella believe that Indians’ bone marrow enables them to dream, but Frenchie finds the starry universe to be his “medicine” with which he “dreams of north” (Dimaline, loc. 168). His narrative shows that the essence – the marrow – of indigenous faith is in no way anthropocentric but instead inspired by nature and in harmony with it. The faith supports Frenchie to the extent that despite his destitution, he pities the dreamless colonizers “shutting off like factory machines at the end of a shift” (Dimaline, loc. 243).  By acknowledging nature’s agency and heeding its inspiration, indigenous people are empowered far more spiritually than material extraction would satisfy the colonizers. But the reckless extraction continues and deprives indigenous people of their culture anchor. Frenchie’s description of a river he encounters expresses the pain following this deprival: He sees the river “bled from somewhere up the hill and carried itself with quiet grace across the tortured ground” and “tenacious roots dangled … like old ladies dipping vein-bruised legs into a pool” (Dimaline, loc. 2232). His metaphor embodies such injury and lifelessness that to readers the landscape bears marks of the inhabitants’ suffering. Thus, his narrative condenses colonial environment exploitation “that patiently dispenses its devastation” (Nixon, 6): The vision of a bleeding river exposes their ignored impact on indigenous minds in its most appalling form. Postcolonial environmentalists thereby voice aloud their belief in human-nature harmony and expose the long-ignored violence that has suppressed their folk for holding it.</p>
  <p>Their voices arouse attention for a struggle far from finished but almost already forgotten. Postcolonial environmentalism still faces tremendous obstacles due to its intersectionality. When colonies have been emancipated and Euro-American environmentalists have gained global recognition, the environmental violence that indigenous people still endure is too easily overlooked. Dimaline expresses her concern by depicting neo-colonial environmentalism from the view of a wise yet silenced First Nation: “Treaties and agreements shook on between world leaders in echoing assembly halls” (Dimaline, loc. 383), but the council of First Nation elders are forced to huddle “in a low, wide room filled on both sides with tents” (loc. 2368) inside well-hidden caves. The contrast between two spaces externalize the great disparity in the influence of their voices. Intersectionality prevents indigenous environmentalists from having a place in the global discourse. But as long as an anthropocentric desire to exploit nature persists, the vulnerable indigenous habitats will “feel the brunt first and foremost” (Riahi & McSorley). And so long as postcolonial nations remain outside the attention span of global environmentalism, such ignorance will be exploited, and constantly more “poisonous brick mushrooms” (Dimaline, 1290) will grow in indigenous homelands: In the first quarter of 2020, militarized raid occurred “on Wet’suweten territory in British Columbia to enforce the corporate construction of the Coastal GasLink Pipeline” (Ingwersen). To disperse the fumes over the First Nation requires postcolonial environmentalists to challenge two intertwined oppressive structures at once. But the environmentalists also have powerful means at hand. They invoke the power in narratives to express long-lasting indigenous wisdom to a global audience. They tell stories that stem from the collective memory of the oppressed.</p>
