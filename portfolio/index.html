  <h1>Author Archives: Hanwen Zhang</h1>
  <p>Weclome! My name is Hanwen Zhang. I come from Shanghai and I am currently studying at Middlebury College in Vermont, USA. My main area of academic interest is sociology but I also explore myriad topics in other social sciences and humanities. Recently I have been reading and writing about cognitive divides across different social categories (race, class, status). Below are some of my short essays. I hope they turn out an enjoyable and meaningful read for anyone interested.</p>

  <h2><a href="https://hanwzhang.github.io/portfolio/sociology.html">Sociology</a></h2>
  <p>Sociology to me is an imagination that brings life troubles and social movements into a sharp focus - Which of the social phenomena we observe are very situational which ones apply to broader contexts? Here I expand and explore sociological theories in familiar contexts: suburban life, consumer society, and a pandemic-striken year. The theme "epistemology of ignorance" keeps appearing and is particularly interesting. <a href="https://hanwzhang.github.io/portfolio/sociology.html">Read more</a></p>
  <b class="one"><h3><a href="https://hanwzhang.github.io/portfolio/essays/dancing-aunties.html">Dancing Aunties</a></h3><p>A mathematical inquiry of organizer-member dichotomy: With methods inspired by Rytina and Morgan's <i><a href="https://www.journals.uchicago.edu/doi/10.1086/227635">the Arithemtic of Social Relations</a></i>, I analyze this most common social construct and put my model to a brief test on urban dance groups. We find that as the group enlarges in search for diverse information, the organizer category relatively shrinks. This makes each member hold increasingly more indirect ties and distances the members from one another.</p></b>
  <b class="one"><h3><a href="https://hanwzhang.github.io/portfolio/essays/privacy-and-prejudice.html">Privacy and Prejudice</a></h3><p>Like Jane Austen's characters, modern suburban dwellers also cultivate a prejudice among themselves. Seclusion gives them control over the intensity and content of their social interaction. They thus keep their situated views unchallenged and deny external realities like racism and urban poverty. Suburban housewives who have mostly intra-community interactions reproduce the situated knowledge across households and generations as they educate children.</p></b>
  <b class="one"><h3><a href="https://hanwzhang.github.io/portfolio/essays/buying-ones-way-up.html">Buying One's Way up</a></h3><p>Consuming marker commodities enables individuals to obtain status and its corresponding privilege. Such gained privilege contributes to class mobility. But the upper class also redefines their status and adopts new markers while convincing aspiring entrants that elite status markers are determinant of elite position. Thus, aspiring entrants with obsolete markers fail to gain recognition and chase after new ones while elite capitalists benefit from their consumption.</p></b>

    <h2><a href="https://hanwzhang.github.io/portfolio/postcolonial-lit.html">Postcolonial Literature</a></h2>
    <p>Postcolonial literature is and is about the aftermath of colonialism. Ex-colonies face a struggle against persisting oppression and public ignorance of past atrocities. Narratives are one of their few weapons in this struggle - yet a powerful one. These essays are inspired by class discussions of postcolonial literary works and cover topics including intersectionality (synergy of multiple oppressive structures, invisible intersectional groups, etc.), diaspora, and postcolonial environmentalism. <a href="https://hanwzhang.github.io/portfolio/postcolonial-lit.html">Read more</a></p>
      <b class="one"><h3><a href="https://hanwzhang.github.io/portfolio/essays/fumes-over-the-first-nation.html">Fumes over the First Nation</a></h3><p>This piece is inspired by Cherie Dimaline's novella <i>The Marrow Thieves</i>. Her work imagines from a first-person view the mental turbulence of First Nation Canadians in a dystopian future. This essays reviews her work with reference to the realities of environmentalism in the postcolonial age.</p></b>
      <b class="one"><h3><a href="https://hanwzhang.github.io/portfolio/essays/freeing-their-mournable-bodies.html">Freeing Their Mournable Bodies</a></h3><p>Here I analyze oppressive social structures drawing on <i>This Mournable Body</i>, a searing novel by Zimbabwean writer Tsitsi Dangarembga. I discuss the synergy of patriarchy and colonialism in a Zimbabwean context and its implications for the world.</p></b>
      <b class="one"><h3><a href="https://hanwzhang.github.io/portfolio/essays/a-spiral-into-prejudice.html">A Spiral into Prejudice</a></h3><p>Here we look into how Sir Arthur Conan Doyle’s <a class="span">the Adventure of Speckled Band</a> depicts the imperial British veterans. The group gained wealth and status from colonial expansion as the old aristocracy declined. This hierarchical shift stimulated widespread opportunism, for which the demonized orient took blame.</p></b>

  <h2><a href="https://hanwzhang.github.io/portfolio/german.html">German</a></h2>
  <p>These works are completed in German and about German culture. Most content is tightly connected to the Weimar Republic and the Netflix Series Babylon Berlin. <a href="https://hanwzhang.github.io/portfolio/german.html">Read more</a></p>
    <b class="one"><h3><a href="https://hanwzhang.github.io/portfolio/essays/der-tanz-der-zukunft.html">Der Tanz der Zukunft</a></h3><p>Die Novelle <a class="span">Unordnung und frühes Leid</a> von Thomas Mann, die zunächst in 1925 publiziert ist und das Leben von einer bürgerlichen Familie nach dem Krieg beschreibt, spiegelt diesen Streit wider. Dieser Aufsatz analysiert die symbolische Bedeutung der literarischen Figuren.</p></b>
    <b class="two"><h3><a href="https://www.bilibili.com/video/BV1Yv411r7Nj">Das Selbstpotrait eines Pressfotografen</a></h3><p>Mit einem Film präsentiere ich ein Selbstpotrait eines Pressfotografen in der Weimarer Zeit.
