  <h1>Essays in Sociology</h1>

  <p>It is an imagination that brings life troubles and social movements into a sharp focus - Which of the social phenomena we observe are very situational which ones apply to broader contexts? Here I expand and explore sociological theories in familiar contexts: suburban life, consumer society, and a pandemic-striken year. The theme "epistemology of ignorance" keeps appearing and is particularly interesting.</p>
  <h2><a href="https://hanwzhang.github.io/portfolio/essays/dancing-aunties.html">Dancing Aunties</a></h2>
  <p>A mathematical inquiry of organizer-member dichotomy: With methods inspired by Rytina and Morgan's <i><a href="https://www.journals.uchicago.edu/doi/10.1086/227635">the Arithemtic of Social Relations</a></i>, I analyze this most common social construct and put my model to a brief test on urban dance groups. We find that as the group enlarges in search for diverse information, the organizer category relatively shrinks. This makes each member hold increasingly more indirect ties and distances the members from one another.</p>

  <p>Like Jane Austen's characters, modern suburban dwellers also cultivate a prejudice among themselves. Seclusion gives them control over the intensity and content of their social interaction. They thus keep their situated views unchallenged and deny external realities like racism and urban poverty. Suburban housewives who have mostly intra-community interactions reproduce the situated knowledge across households and generations as they educate children.</p>

  <p>Consuming marker commodities enables individuals to obtain status and its corresponding privilege. Such gained privilege contributes to class mobility. But the upper class also redefines their status and adopts new markers while convincing aspiring entrants that elite status markers are determinant of elite position. Thus, aspiring entrants with obsolete markers fail to gain recognition and chase after new ones while elite capitalists benefit from their consumption.</p>
