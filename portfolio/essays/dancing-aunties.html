<h1>Dancing aunties: An Analysis of the Organizer-Member Dichotomy</h1>
<p>2020.11.7</p>
<p>In almost every Chinese city, groups of city-dwellers in their late fifties and sixties gather every day after dinner on plazas, squares and empty grounds to dance. Square dance in urban China is sociologically different from group dance in tribes, at aristocratic parties, or in socialist communes: The participants are mostly retired women and previously strangers from different backgrounds. One joins upon invitation by an organizer and hardly knows any other member. Between two songs or after a day’s dance they mingle in small groups about chores, commodity prices, and their family. The group socializes previously detached individuals into networks, and they benefit from diversified connections. Square dance groups are ideal for studying connection formation in organizer-member dichotomous groups. Using tie-accounts table to map inter-category and intra-category ties (Rytina and Morgan, 89), we find that as the group enlarges in search for diverse information, the organizer category relatively shrinks. This makes each member hold increasingly more distant ties relative to direct ones. Distortion thus accumulates along longer ties and connections become more dehumanized.</p>
<p>To construct the tie-accounts table, we denote that a group has n members, k of which are organizers. Three assumptions are made based on the observation of square dance groups. Firstly, the organizers are directly connected to one another to coordinate activities (<a class="math">IN<sub>org</sub>=k-1</a>). Secondly, each member is directly tied to exactly one organizer, the one that invites him/her to join (<a class="math">OUT<sub>mem</sub>=1</a>). Thirdly, members only converse with a small and constant number of fellow members dancing nearby. We denote this with <a class="math">IN<sub>mem</sub>=m</a>. These assumptions are applicable to many other urban organizations where “a very small number of people are linked to everyone else, and the rest of us are linked through those few” (Gladwell, 3). Organizers are operations managers that host events for workers who barely socialize outside their nearby cubicles, or students who join multiple clubs at school, to name a few. Because inter-category ties are numerically symmetric, an organizer has on average (n-k)/k ties to members (<a class="math">OUT<sub>org</sub>=(n-k)/k</a>).</p>
	Destination of ties	Average number of ties
Origin of ties	Number of persons	To organizers	To members
From organizers	k	k-1	(n-k)/k	T_org=k-1+(n-k)/k
From members	n-k	1	m	T_mem=1+m

Figure 1. Tie-accounts table given IN<sub>org</sub>=k-1, OUT<sub>mem</sub>=1, IN<sub>mem</sub>=m.
The first finding is that the organizer category shrinks relatively as the group grows. We see that T_org is a function of k whose positive branch has a minimum. Socially, this means an expansive organizer group allows each to connect fewer members, while an austere organizing structure requires each to connect more members. For organizers in rationalized systems, more internal ties mean more complex negotiations in decision making, while more to-member ties mean extra burden to “guide or force people to choose certain means to ends” (Ritzer, 40). Since both are laborious, organizers balance them and opt for minimal T_org. This is achieved when (dT_org)/dk=1+(-k-(n-k))/k^2 =0. In this case k=√n. The rational “lazy” organizers keep their number to 1/√n of a group of n people. The organizers manage growing groups by expanding, but proportionally less. They make up an increasingly small proportion of the group. Intuitively, the larger the group, the less chance one can find people who want to shoulder the organizing burden.
However, groups cannot grow indefinitely, because the relatively shrinking organizer category makes ties more distant and members less cohered. Using the concept of chain length – the number of middlemen in a tie (Granovetter, 1365) we can identify 3 types of ties in this dichotomous group. A member has 1+m zero-degree ties (T_0) and one-degree ties (T_1) equal to T_org because the acquainted organizer is the middleman. The rest of the group is all accessible via two organizers, so T_2=n-T_0-T_1. If we suppose lazy organizers, then T_1=2√n-2. Figure 2 compares how T_0, T_1, T_2 change as n increases. The branch where n>1 is considered.

As the group enlarges, the proportion of distant ties grows significantly while that of intimate ties shrinks. Socially, this means increasingly more information is delivered through distant links. That information is likely distorted, for “the probability that ‘whatever it is’ will flow” correctly between people is “inversely proportional to the length of the path” (Granovetter, 1365). For example, a dancer now conceives a fellow dancer through descriptions remarked by others instead of through directly watching his/her moves. Further, they do “increasingly precise calculations” to discuss if each other’s children achieve the success defined by “bureaucracy, modern law, and the capitalist economy” (Ritzer, 38-39). Then the children are hardly cohered, because they are reduced on the opposite end of their tie to rationalized measurements that their mothers habitually make. In trying to expand the group for more diverse information, individuals end up receiving vestigial information that went through extra rationalizing filters. This is equally true for firms where employees exchange work inefficiently but department heads are too few to help. The implication is that dichotomous groups tend toward an equilibrium size to keep ties intimate. At this equilibrium, members are diverse while reachable via one-degree ties, and there are relatively sufficient organizers working to increase m and thus facilitate more zero-degree ties among members.
For a coarse test of the findings, 6 dance groups are observed. 4 out of 6 groups size between 20 and 27 members, likely the range of equilibrium group size in this context. Group and number of organizers are presented in Figure 3 and k(n) shows the expected relation. Many external influences are not controlled, nevertheless group A, B, D generally adhere to the model. Group C, E, F do not. Notably, group C and E differ in that they have a much higher proportion of participants mingling on the bench at rest. Group F are waltz dancers closely tied in pairs. These suggest alternative cohesive structures to a member-organizer dichotomy: a group with specialized subgroups for tie-building, or a group where dyads instead of individuals are the element. Both structures increase zero-degree ties and bypass organizers to enhance group cohesion.

Our analysis shows that an organizer-member dichotomy – a rational structure that many urban institutions adopt – has communicative limits. As groups extend for more diverse information and connections, organizers shrink proportionally and an increasing proportion of ties become distant. Distant ties dehumanize connections and allow distortion of information to accumulate. As the expansion of this rational structure produces irrationality, multi-layered or non-dichotomous organizations are necessary to bypass its limits. But it is likely that the antagonism between diversified sources of information and authentic pathways persists in any social network. The effort to construct fixed structures in turn keeps the structure of groups in a constant flux of expansion, dilution, and reorganizing.
