<h1>Individual Effervescence?: Understanding Reclusion as a Norm</h1>
<p>2020.9.22</p>
<h2>Introduction</h2>
<p>In <a class="span">the Elementary Forms of Religious Life</a>, Emile Durkheim reasoned that societies have “the need of upholding and reaffirming at regular intervals the collective sentiments” (Durkheim 474) to stay concentrated and in solidarity. It followed that individuals must engage in communal rituals – both religious and secular – to best recreate the presence of collective sentiments as “an experimental proof of their beliefs” (Durkheim 464). But facts challenge this conclusion: one sees not rare examples but long-lasting trends where individuals voluntarily choose to exclude themselves from the collective and obtain strength from reclusion. In the realm of religion, Christianity and Buddhism both developed eremitism, characterized by a life in solitude and practiced by believers believed to have the strongest faith. In the secular world, too, socially-active individuals will escape from collective life at regular intervals. Here we discuss if reclusion is a norm instead of individual deviances. It is the effervescence to recreate individuality without intruding collective consciousness, so that society reconciles their conflict and stays engaged with both.</p>
<h2>Recluses accept collective consciousness</h2>
<p>The most intuitive way to interpret reclusion is to say recluses are deviants whose aspirations are in conflict with that of society. And because social structure “asserts itself as soon as I attempt to resist it” (Durkheim 2), the only way to preserve such individuality from social coercion is to retract from social involvement altogether. In other words, recluses repel the collective consciousness and thus rituals that reaffirm it. But narratives of recluses show they are not repellant to collective consciousness: Yang Xiong, recluse in Later-Han-Dynasty China, conceived a recluse’s mission as to “remain inconspicuously among the people, where through his teaching and personal example he continues to work for the transformation of the world” (Berkowitz).</p>
<p>Further, if reclusion is a deviance caused by individual abnormalities, then society will hardly accept it, let alone normalize it. This is also inconsistent with reality: Canon Law 603 of the Catholic Church recognizes “the eremitic or anchoritic life by which the Christian faithful devote their life to the praise of God … through a stricter withdrawal from the world” (Code of Canon Law). Reclusion is normalized and codified as a section of the religious institution. The fact that society and the recluse endorse instead of repel each other shows that reclusion is a norm not to be dismissed as individual deviances. Recluses accept collective sentiments instead of rejecting them. But they prefer individual rituals, and this makes Durkheim’s account of these rituals as “only a very rudimentary cult” (Durkheim 472) insufficient. The normalization of reclusion reflects a social need for individual rituals in addition to collective effervescence. Then, why is there such a need? Is it to supplement or to counter collective effervescence?</p>
<h2>Reconciliation of individuality-collectivity conflicts</h2>
<p>In a secular context, most reclusion takes place in the form of spending short periods of time away from the routine collective communities of school or work. We coined them days off, holiday expeditions, gap years for travelling, etc., but the common element is to temporarily engage in activities that show greater individuality and are not governed by the “rhythm of social life” (Durkheim 488), which is negotiated through collective rituals. None of such temporary reclusions, however, aims to overthrow the collective rhythm: Individuals all return to their communities after these short breaks, and those who experience prolonged reclusion are troubled by the lack of collective pace. The latter phenomenon is well experienced when “social distancing to counter the virus has left us – habitual hermits included – craving the socialization we claim to have evolved beyond” (Yartasi). To make individuality crowd out collectivity would be to revolt against all social norms. To recluse, on the other hand, is to reconcile their conflict and stay engaged in both. Reclusion allows for recreation of individuality via experiences that are completely distinct from that of social life (i.e. collective effervescence), so that collectivity and individuality are manifested in different spaces. Their conflict is thus reconciled without one crowding out the other. For instance, if a bureaucrat believes in government austerity and avoids exercising power in an interventionist office, he/she will either be coerced by his colleagues to conform or convert them (and likely fail). He therefore writes cases for austerity during his temporary reclusion from office instead, maintaining his individuality but “not overtly manifest in worldly conduct within the public, political sphere—hidden” (Berkowitz). The analysis reveals that reclusion is a normalized effervescence to manifest individuality without intruding collective life. It results from persisting individuality-collectivity conflict, and it reincarnates in all individual recluses across history as a norm.</p>
<h2>Do complete eremites compromise for collectivity?</h2>
<p>One may question how the conclusion above accounts for monks that practice complete reclusion the entire life, who seem to abandon collective effervescence altogether. A possible explanation would be that they perform rituals that does not require temporal or spatial copresence. Thus, they lead individualized eremitic lives, but reconciles with the collectivity in that they share common beliefs and rituals with their predecessors and their contemporaries elsewhere – like abstinence and prayer words. Buddhist eremitic grottoes had been constructed on the Mo Gao cliff in succession for over 1200 years (Britannica), exemplifying asynchronous collective rituals. The hermits’ acceptance of disciples and followers that supposedly “suck him back into the social order from which he meant to escape” (Jewdokimow 37) also suggests some reconciliation with collective life.</p>
<h2>Reclusion then and now</h2>
<p>It follows, from the previous analysis, that reclusion is less an autonomous choice of the often-self-declared disengaged recluse but more a mechanism developed by society to cope with its structural changes. Supporting this is the fact that holiday celebration in mechanical societies are preoccupied by heightened communal rituals, such as town-dwellers gathering in the square for parades and feasts, whereas in specialized organic societies they feature individualized trips or meals in groups often as small as the nuclear family. As an extension to Durkheim' theory, just like how mechanical solidarity both presumes and creates collective rituals, the coexistence of individual and collective effervescence is also both needed and created by an increasingly organic society where individuality and collectivity needs to be reconciled with one another. Reclusion is not the rejection of collective life. It results from the conflict between individuality and collective consciousness, and is a norm creating distinct room for the manifestations for both, thus reconciling their conflict without compromising individuality. This has implications for understanding forced reclusion from physical copresence experienced globally in the COVID-19 pandemic, too. Foremost, the “forced” nature of quarantine creates an inconsistency between norm and social structure, namely between intensified reclusion and constant, even reduced, individual-collective conflict. We are forced to reaffirm the strength collective life gives us – for which in crisis we especially feel the need – through rituals like reading or video-partying whose collectiveness is only remote or asynchronous or both. Also, since the purpose of reclusion is only to reconcile individuality with collectivity instead of providing an alternative for the latter, it becomes clear why we find temporary breaks from daily routines enjoyable but “binge-watching Netflix loses its appeal” (Yartasi) in prolonged isolation. What reconciles individuality with collective life can hardly fill in for the latter’s absence, but nevertheless we rely upon them to do so. Thus, reclusion will not be restored to its normal role until collective norms are practiced and experienced strongly in society again.</p>
