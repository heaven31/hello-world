  <h1>A Spiral into Prejudice: Imperial British Society Reflected in <a class="span">the Adventure of Speckled Band</a></h1>
  <p>2020.9.28</p>
  <p>Many scholars discuss how British hegemony shaped oriental societies, but few pay attention to how colonialism sparked changes in British society. The empire was not a static, undifferentiated group of oppressors. Instead, new classes rose and social norms shifted as colonial expansion progressed. Here we analyze how Sir Arthur Conan Doyle’s <a class="span">the Adventure of Speckled Band</a> reflects one impact of colonialism on British society: A veteran class who gained wealth and status from colonial expansion emerged as the old aristocracy declined. This hierarchical shift stimulated widespread opportunism, which then solidified the demonization of the orient.</p>
  <p>The rise of the veteran class was described through its contrast with the old aristocrats. Helen Stoner stated that her late mother “young widow of Major-General Stoner of the Bengal Artillery” left a wealth “enough for all our wants and there seemed to be no obstacle for our happiness” (Doyle, loc. 6828). The early passing of Major-General Stoner and his wife contrasted with the lasting material satisfaction of their daughters, showing that officers in colonial warfare gained considerable wealth in a short time. In sharp contrast, a depiction of the dilapidated Stoke Moran estate reflects a decline of the Saxon aristocrat, the Roylotts. “Gray, lichen-blotched stone” (Doyle, loc. 7017) and “brown, worm-eaten oak, so old and discolored” (Doyle, 7041) making up the mansion all pointed to weathering and decay. This not only reveals Dr. Roylott’s lack of wealth to refurnish the estate, but also objectifies the fall of aristocrats from their privilege. Helen Stoner’s remark of her stepfather as an “aristocratic pauper” (Doyle, loc. 6819) further shows that his bloodline no longer provided wealth or reverence from the emerging class. Thus, the novella constructed two classes of distinct fate. The rise of veterans to a higher hierarchy in the empire paralleled the decline of old aristocrats. Such transfer of privilege created tension between the two classes, which culminated when Dr. Roylott attempted to murder his stepdaughters to hold on to the Stoners’ wealth and resist his decline into poverty.</p>
  <p>Roylott’s crime, therefore, was an aristocrat’s desperate revolt against his downfall and an excellent reflection of British opportunism caused by colonial expansion. People returning to Britain from the orient with great wealth pressed others in need of it to follow and “adapt himself to the new conditions” (Doyle, loc. 6820) by means fair or foul. Dr. Roylott exemplified such trend. After his lawful business “by his professional skill and his force of character” (Doyle, loc. 6820) failed, he unscrupulously planned to murder his stepdaughters for their share of the widow’s wealth. Doyle depicted him following Helen Stoner as having “resemblance to a fierce old bird of prey” (Doyle, loc. 6956), showing that he had lost the gentlemanly manners of a noble and became occupied by his greed. In addition to Roylott’s degradation, a selective distortion of moral principles also inadvertently reflects imperial opportunism. When Dr. Roylott was poisoned by his snake, Holmes despised him as a schemer who “falls into the pit which he digs for another” (Doyle, loc. 7183) and deserved such retribution. In contrast, no one ever questioned the righteousness of Major-General Stoner’s gaining wealth from warfare in Bengal, by equally cruel means. Holmes and his creator justified murder for wealth when it targeted the orient but condemned it when it targeted members of the empire. And they were themselves unaware of such self-contradiction: Holmes still authoritatively announced “violence recoils upon the violent” (Doyle, loc. 7183), showing that even the most rational imperialist was not aware of his own inconsistency. In sum, the empire altered morals and normalized distorted values solely in its own defense, while its British citizens took the distorted values for granted.</p>
  <p>ronically, naturalized opportunism then made Britons conceive the orient as instruments of unscrupulous schemes and demonize it. This is best shown when Doyle represented the orient with a baboon and a snake. Watson’s only direct encounter with oriental entities was with Roylott’s pets – a baboon with “writhing limbs” (Doyle, loc. 7139) and a snake like “a peculiar yellow band with brown speckles” (Doyle, loc. 7176). He therefore developed a completely negative impression of the orient as either “hideous and distorted” (Doyle, loc. 7139) or “loathsome” (Doyle, loc. 7185). He oriental encounter was typical of the imperial Britons, and reflects how they demonized the orient because they were only exposed to its peculiarities brought to Britain for malicious purposes, but not its merit. In addition, the snake with “poison which could not possibly be discovered” was manipulated by “the clever ruthless man who had had an Eastern training” (Doyle, loc. 7203), which constituted the pattern of a schemer colluding with a covert evil force.  Watson thus conceived the orient as a supplier of artifices for opportunists. Based on this conception, the snake’s “turning upon its master” convinced Watson that the orient was a treacherous, violent threat that needed to be “thrusted back into its den” (Doyle, loc. 7211). Doyle’s use of snake as a metaphor reveals how demonization of the orient may encourage even more opportunistic, aggressive expansion in the name of controlling it. The ascension of colonial veterans was predicated by such opportunism, and they preached it through their new hegemony. On tasting its terrible consequence, however, they arrogantly laid blame on the offender’s “long residence in the orient” (Doyle, loc. 6833). Thus, the backfiring of their opportunism never led to reflection on the aftermath of colonialism, but only demonized the orient and convinced the colonizers more of their conquering mission. As Edward Said succinctly put it, they saw “more a mirror image of themselves and their own assumptions” (Young, 16).</p>
  <p>Identifying the feedback loop between opportunism and demonization of the orient offers new insights into imperial British society. When Dr. Roylott, who was made into an opportunist by the empire but failed to prosper in the east, coveted the treasure of his fellow Britons, his victims actually experienced “the aftermath of the colonial” (Young, 13). Intensified conflicts between colonialists who gained and those who did not menaced the empire. But due to a collective indulgence in self-assumed superiority, British people’s postcolonial encounter did not make them “relinquish their monopoly on knowledge” (Young, 15).</p>
  <p>Therefore, in addition to mapping the imperial terrain, Doyle also inadvertently revealed the difficulty of uprooting self-justifying colonial hegemony: Clearly, experiencing its disastrous consequences alone was not enough to undermine it. The Adventure of Speckled Band shows how imperial Britain interpreted its postcolonial encounters for self-defense instead of self-reflection, and thus solidified public prejudices. A rising veteran class was depicted in comparison to declining aristocrats, revealing how a transfer of wealth and privilege encouraged opportunism to seek fortune in the orient. The characters’ response to Dr. Roylott’s crime further revealed how morals were distorted to condemn opportunism against Britons but encourage the same exploitation against the colonized. Then, when such opportunism backfired on the empire, the colonialists did not acknowledge their own immorality. Instead, they interpreted the offences for further demonization of the orient – exemplified by Doyle’s representation of it with predatory animals – to justify more, not less, colonial oppression. As can be seen, imperial Britain had started to experience the aftermath of colonialism. To the detriment of contemporary readers, however, they did not identify its cause and spiraled into a deeper conviction of their prejudice.</p>
