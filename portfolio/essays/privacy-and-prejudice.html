<h1>Privacy and prejudice: Rethinking seclusion in the context of suburbanization</h1>
<p>2020.12.3</p>
<p>Last month I was invited by a middle-school friend to a movie party at her new suburban home. The Brown freshwoman introduced her “remote college dormitory”: a villa with 3 bedrooms, a 40-square-meter terrace and a makeshift family cinema, with her mother, a full-time housewife, making sure all the young guests are at ease. The neighborhood comprises of around 150 similar villas distanced from one another and is managed by uniformed cleaners and security guards asking every visitor for an invitation from the residents. My friend accounts for her own “remote Brown” as tranquil, free, while seasoned with barbecue on the terrace and movie nights with close friends. She finds it hard to understand the anxieties among other remote students and, ironically enough, on their Providence campus.</p>
<p>Not only among remote students, but in elite suburban neighborhoods in general, a “social alexithymia” (Mueller, 229) to external realities is created. Suburban communities are secluded from the urban crowd, and with lower population density each individual member is also secluded from one another. Seclusion gives individuals control over the intensity and content of their social interaction. By filtering their own interactions, suburban residents keep their situated views unchallenged and deny external realities like racism and urban poverty. Suburban housewives who have mostly intra-community interactions reproduce the situated knowledge across households and generations as they educate children. Because moving to the suburbs has been affordable exclusively for middle- and upper-class families, most of which in the U.S were white when suburbanization began, racist and elite knowledge is reproduced in the secluded suburbs against external social realities. As a modern urban privilege, seclusion can heighten situated perceptions of society by enabling the denial of realities that are at odds with it.</p>
<p>Suburban dwellers are predominantly white, elite, and have greater privacy than urban dwellers. While leaving crowded, aging city centers in search for better amenities is perfectly justified, class and racial inequalities are already reproduced through this seemingly impartial process. In the U.S., African Americans are “systematically excluded from suburban residential locations by individual and institutional discrimination in the real estate and banking industries” (Massey & Tannen, 1594). In the following decades and in other countries, the middle class flowed into the suburbs to avoid “being around poor people … poor schools, unsafe streets, gangs” (de Witt). Despite the recent soaring migration of minorities and lower class into American suburbs due to deteriorating urban housing conditions, their spatial segregation from the elite white suburbs largely persists (Massey & Tannen, 1595). Through suburbanization the white and the elite are legitimately segregated from the poor and the minorities. The spacious and thinly populated suburbs then grant privacy to its elite residents. Different from the city-dwellers’ “freedom of movement” in an indifferent crowd (Simmel, 16), suburban privacy means one has control over the type and intensity of one’s social interactions: One can choose which crowd to be in, or if to be in a crowd at all. My friend can either have a quiet day or throw a party with Ivy-League friends in her secluded villa, while her peers in packed apartment buildings and public libraries have less say in whom they encounter and how frequently. The same disparity is seen in Hagerman’s comparison of three white communities: Sheridan’s relative seclusion from city center allows it to stay exclusively white. But residents of Evergreen and Wheaton Hill in the city encounter minority citizens no matter willingly or not (166).</p>
<p>Increased control over social circles produces a situated knowledge: Elite suburban dwellers reimagine the social reality outside their communities to ignore their privilege over poor, minority urban dwellers. Living in a suburban white community reduces a white family’s contact with minority groups to merely work or school exchange. Naturally, an ignorance of racial inequality is produced. Families hold their current privilege as deserved since they believe “racism isn’t a problem anymore” (Hagerman, 1). Even when faced with evidence of racism, they can easily invoke their “racial obliviousness” to “repair moral breaches” (Mueller, 230). In addition to producing legitimate racial ignorance, the suburbs also create an ignorance of urban dilapidation, the very reason why elites have settled in the suburbs. Office workers from suburban families perceive the city center exclusively through their workplace and transportation routes – not coincidentally the most well-maintained parts. Should they choose private vehicles, their contact with the center is even further limited. Full-time housewives and children have few direct encounters with the city center; When they do go there, they choose to go mostly for cultural and entertainment services. In this way suburban dwellers inevitably romanticize the urban space. The commercialized, developed parts are hyper-visible but dilapidation in poor communities becomes invisible. The construction of ignorance is largely unintentional, but the resulting knowledge persists because it resolves the moral burden of holding privilege.</p>
<p>Full-time housewives in suburban communities are a medium through which this alexithymia heighten and spread. On one hand, elite housewives have the fewest contact with external realities and thus maintain the suburban situated knowledge most easily. On the other hand, they choose domesticity voluntarily. They are highly involved in the education of children and in community affairs – an act they regard as morally superior to the common urban indifference. Through their connections, they enhance the neutralized or even romanticized conception of social realities within the community and pass it on as they rear children. As a child in Hagerman’s survey of white suburbs reports, a poor neighborhood “isn’t where they usually go” when his mother drives despite its proximity, and his mother “says it’s dangerous” (9). Housewives are shielded from interactions that challenge their situated knowledge and reproduce those that enhance it through well-intentioned care for their own children and community. Therefore, hosting parties for her daughter does not make my friend’s mother responsible for class ignorance among young elites; The community devotion of elite suburban housewives is undisputedly virtuous. But their devotion carries existing ignorance further.</p>
<p>The suburbs continue to be secluded spaces for individuals to heighten situated knowledge and deny external realities at odds with it. It can be inferred that similar incentives may have driven Christian monks and ancient Chinese thinkers to practice reclusion. The privacy as a recluse enables hermit monks to heighten their own perception of “collective sentiments” that raise him “above the miseries of the world” (Durkheim, 464) undisturbed by realities in dissonance with it. For thinkers, withdrawal from the social reality enables their intellectual construction of ideal societies and allows for a life adhering to the ideals. In general, the secluded individual can experience or conceive collectiveness in ways that he or she find most desirable. Thus, seclusion can give rise to the most strong-willed believers. But the search for privacy can also produce ignorance and reinforce prejudice, which necessitates responsible middlemen to inform secluded communities of social realities. The production of prejudice from privacy deserves particular attention: Since Du Bois critiqued “car-window sociologists” (Ch.8) who observe social facts from afar, there is every reason to be alarmed by spatial structures that make individuals perceive society through the windows of their suburban villas and reimagine their status in it.</p>
