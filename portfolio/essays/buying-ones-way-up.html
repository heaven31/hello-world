<h1>Buying One’s Way up: The Impact of Consumption on Social Mobility</h1>
<p>2020.10.18</p>
<h2>Introduction</h2>
<p>The world we live in now appears as increasingly rid of definitive class divisions: people on opposite poles of the income spectrum can wear similar brands, enjoy similar entertainment, and hence encounter each other like equals. But this does not mean class divisions have disappeared or ceased to shape life trajectories. While consuming commodities help lower-class individuals gain recognition and privileges that they otherwise lack, it also obscures and even upholds persisting class divisions maintained through consumerism. Class and status groups are intersecting social hierarchies. Classes are divided according to income, wealth, and the ability to generate more wealth from it. The lower class who “find work only so long as their labour increases capital” (Marx, Ch. 1) can hardly accumulate wealth, while the upper class uses capital to obtain even more. Status, on the other hand, is determined by a “social estimation” of “a specific style of life” (Weber, 187). To hold status requires social appreciation of one’s lifestyle, and correspondingly society assigns privileges to people according to their status. Consuming marker commodities enables individuals to obtain status and its corresponding privilege. Such privilege contributes to class mobility. But the upper class also redefines their status and adopts new markers. Thus, aspiring entrants with obsolete markers fail to gain recognition and chase after new ones while elite capitalists benefit from their consumption. To perpetuate such system, the upper class portrays elite status markers as determinant of their position, thus making class hierarchies seem conquerable by consumption. Consumption becomes the tool to reproduce and naturalize class inequality.</p>
<h2>From commodities to status</h2>
<p>Since privilege can only be gained if one’s status is socially recognized, individuals are compelled to manifest their status to others, using the material world as a medium. But creating one’s own status marker is viable for neither capitalists, who don’t create by themselves, nor workers, whose creation “confronts themselves as something alien” (Marx, XXII). Thus, individuals in the capitalist society resort to owning commodities as status markers. Status groups choose marker commodities according to their varying exclusiveness, which may initially arise from scarcity. Then the association of the commodity with a status group reinforces itself. For example, successful businesspeople would prefer an Audi over a Volkswagen to distinguish themselves, even if the two are mechanically similar; Then Audi’s reputation as “the bosses’ ride” increases its appeal to businesspeople, and status tags are socially imprinted into commodities. Low-starters that save up for an Audi and display it to business partners can be recognized as a successful boss, and have better chances to settle a good deal. Individuals can leverage the status tags of commodities to “signal success in a desirable social role” (McNall, 50). And when this entails privileges in terms of better treatment from others, their status factually improves.</p>
<h2>Status and class</h2>
<p>As the example above shows, privileges from higher status provide initial respect and plausibility in interactions. This paves the way for financial success and entrance to a higher class. In that sense, “buying” status bridges classes and provide upward social mobility. But once class positions are obtained, individuals have expanded means to assume new status to legitimize their elite position and create new exclusive markers to replace the already prevalent old ones. The American upper class “described their desires and needs as basic and their spending as disciplined and family-oriented” (The Economist) – their new markers are not flashy cars but education, gym workouts and healthy food. Prudent consumption helps the upper class assume the status of diligence and social responsibility. It legitimizes their privilege to themselves and the aspiring lower class, who had to do the opposite to social-climb. Between 1996 and 2014 the richest 1% fell further behind the American national average in the percentage of spending dedicated to socially visible luxury goods, but the middle-income quintile spent 35% more than the average (The Economist). The dilemma here is that while social climbers consume luxury status markers to gain opportunities, in doing so they distance themselves from the already rich who distinguish themselves via austerity.</p>
<h2>Reaping from social climbers</h2>
<p>This dilemma leaves the lower class with a costly yet obsolete key to the upper class. Social climbers needs markers for recognition by a “bridge” group, but the upper-class constantly recreate exclusive status groups and new markers, and so do not recognize the old ones. Thus, the aspiring lower class becomes trapped in fruitlessly pursuing the changing elite fashion. Competition among the social climbers also drives such pursuit: As more and more individuals consume above their current status, the consumption pattern typical of their status is defined up, and even higher markers are needed to distinguish oneself. One example is the heightened pursuit for higher education when degrees depreciate and “people with graduate degrees receiving … federal aid nearly tripled between 2007 and 2010” (Quart). Meantime, the option forgone for consuming status markers is to save up – a definitive key to the upper class. Thus, buying one’s way up becomes a trap: the lower class ends up where they were and fails to accumulate wealth, while capitalists – sellers of status markers – profit from the workers’ ardent consumption. Wealth inequality is perpetuated through a socially pressured over-consumption for status. It is then worth questioning why the lower class still resorts to consumption to change class positions despite its ineffectiveness rather than saving or seeking to overthrow hierarchies altogether. The reason is that while in fact the elite chooses and displays their own markers, these markers are portrayed and perceived as sole determinants of elite position. The upper class believes that “their position is a product of what they have done” (Khan, 14) – including their wise consumption – “rather than a product of the conditions of their making” (9). They naturally spread the same message since they also profit from ardent consumption. To the lower class, class hierarchies become legitimized because the elites are role models instead of oppressors, and appears conquerable through consumption because their role models are themselves wise consumers. Thus, the meager privileges in interaction from status markers can obscure the persisting class immobility.</p>
<h2>Why buy, not fight?</h2>
<p>It follows, from the previous analysis, that reclusion is less an autonomous choice of the often-self-declared disengaged recluse but more a mechanism developed by society to cope with its structural changes. Supporting this is the fact that holiday celebration in mechanical societies are preoccupied by heightened communal rituals, such as town-dwellers gathering in the square for parades and feasts, whereas in specialized organic societies they feature individualized trips or meals in groups often as small as the nuclear family. As an extension to Durkheim' theory, just like how mechanical solidarity both presumes and creates collective rituals, the coexistence of individual and collective effervescence is also both needed and created by an increasingly organic society where individuality and collectivity needs to be reconciled with one another. Reclusion is not the rejection of collective life. It results from the conflict between individuality and collective consciousness, and is a norm creating distinct room for the manifestations for both, thus reconciling their conflict without compromising individuality. This has implications for understanding forced reclusion from physical copresence experienced globally in the COVID-19 pandemic, too. Foremost, the “forced” nature of quarantine creates an inconsistency between norm and social structure, namely between intensified reclusion and constant, even reduced, individual-collective conflict. We are forced to reaffirm the strength collective life gives us – for which in crisis we especially feel the need – through rituals like reading or video-partying whose collectiveness is only remote or asynchronous or both. Also, since the purpose of reclusion is only to reconcile individuality with collectivity instead of providing an alternative for the latter, it becomes clear why we find temporary breaks from daily routines enjoyable but “binge-watching Netflix loses its appeal” (Yartasi) in prolonged isolation. What reconciles individuality with collective life can hardly fill in for the latter’s absence, but nevertheless we rely upon them to do so. Thus, reclusion will not be restored to its normal role until collective norms are practiced and experienced strongly in society again.</p>
<p>This dilemma leaves the lower class with a costly yet obsolete key to the upper class. Social climbers needs markers for recognition by a “bridge” group, but the upper-class constantly recreate exclusive status groups and new markers, and so do not recognize the old ones. Thus, the aspiring lower class becomes trapped in fruitlessly pursuing the changing elite fashion.

Thus, the meager privileges in interaction from status markers can obscure the persisting class immobility.</p>
<p>On a micro-sociological scale, consuming marker commodities enables individuals to obtain status and its corresponding privileges in interaction with others. Yet from a macro-sociological view, consumption produces antagonizing forces, for it is manipulated both by the lower class to improve their class position and the upper class to secure theirs. The upper class fortifies class hierarchies by devising new markers to render the lower class into a perpetual chase, and naturalizes it by portraying markers as determinants of elite status. It can be argued if material expressions alone determine status recognition: language and behavior can all communicate status in interactions, and even a habitual stare can give undercover bosses away. But there no denying that commodities play a key role in keeping bosses where they are in the first place – in reproducing social hierarchies – while creating a pathway for upward movement. As the constant reconstruction of status markers produces antagonizing forces that stabilize social mobility, social climbers need to be well aware of the limits of commodity status-markers that they purchase.</p>
