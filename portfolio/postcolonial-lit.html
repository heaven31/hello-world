  <h1>Essays in Postcolonial Literature</h1>
  <p>Postcolonial Literature is and is about the aftermath of colonialism. Ex-colonies face a struggle against persisting oppression and public ignorance of past atrocities. Narratives are one of their few weapons in this struggle - yet a powerful one. These essays are inspired by class discussions of postcolonial literary works and cover topics including intersectionality (synergy of multiple oppressive structures, invisible intersectional groups, etc.), diaspora, and postcolonial environmentalism.</p>
  <h2><a href="https://hanwzhang.github.io/portfolio/essays/fumes-over-the-first-nation.html">Fumes over the First Nation</a></h2>
    <p>This piece is inspired by Cherie Dimaline's novella <i>The Marrow Thieves</i>. Her work imagines from a first-person view the mental turbulence of First Nation Canadians in a dystopian future. This essays reviews her work with reference to the realities of environmentalism in the postcolonial age.</p>
  <h2><a href="https://hanwzhang.github.io/portfolio/essays/freeing-their-mournable-bodies.html">Freeing Their Mournable Bodies</a></h2>
    <p>Here I analyze oppressive social structures drawing on <i>This Mournable Body</i>, a searing novel by Zimbabwean writer Tsitsi Dangarembga. I discuss the synergy of patriarchy and colonialism in a Zimbabwean context and its implications for the world.</p>
  <h2><a href="https://hanwzhang.github.io/portfolio/essays/a-spiral-into-prejudice.html">A Spiral into Prejudice</a></h2>
    <p>Here we look into how Sir Arthur Conan Doyle’s <a class="span">the Adventure of Speckled Band</a> depicts the imperial British veterans. The group gained wealth and status from colonial expansion as the old aristocracy declined. This hierarchical shift stimulated widespread opportunism, for which the demonized orient took blame.</p>
